		<h1> Meet the Sign Artists</h1>
		<h2>by Alexa Maldonado </h2>
			<h3> I wanted to make something informative about something I am interested in. I work as one of the few sign artists at my nearby Trader Joe's in New York City and I have come to be fascinated by my work colleagues' process, so I have interviewed them and included some of their work to show the variety of styles. All of us are artists of our own, and I wanted to convey the personal touch that everyone has despite the guidelines we have. </h3>
